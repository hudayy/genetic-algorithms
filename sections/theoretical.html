    <h2>Relationship to Evolutionary Biology</h2>
    <p>
        Genetic algorithms (GAs) mimic natural selection by simulating the
        evolutionary processes observed in nature, such as selection, crossover,
        and mutation, to solve optimization problems. Inspired by Charles Darwin's
        theory of natural selection, GAs start with a population of randomly
        generated individuals, each representing a potential solution encoded as
        chromosomes [1] [8]. These individuals are evaluated based on a fitness
        function that measures how well they solve the problem at hand [8]. The
        fittest individuals are selected to reproduce, ensuring that their
        desirable traits are passed on to the next generation through crossover,
        where segments of parent chromosomes are exchanged to create offspring
        with new combinations of traits [3] [10]. Mutation introduces random
        changes to some genes, maintaining genetic diversity and preventing
        premature convergence to suboptimal solutions [8] [9]. This iterative
        process of selection, crossover, and mutation continues over many
        generations, gradually improving the population's overall fitness and
        converging towards an optimal solution [4] [6]. Various selection methods,
        such as elitism, roulette wheel, tournament, and rank selection, are
        employed to ensure that the best individuals have a higher chance of
        reproducing [8]. Additionally, GAs can be enhanced with hybrid approaches
        and new rules for parent selection to improve their efficiency and
        effectiveness in solving complex problems [7]. Applications of GAs range
        from medical diagnoses and language identification to video game
        simulations and solving classical optimization problems like the Traveling
        Salesman Problem [1] [4] [5] [10]. By mimicking the principles of natural
        evolution, GAs provide a robust and adaptive method for finding
        high-quality solutions in large and complex search spaces [2] [9].

    <h2>Comparison with other optimization techniques</h2>
    <h3>Genetic-Algorithms vs Neural Networks</h3>
    <p>
        Genetic algorithms are search-based optimization algorithms used to find
        optimal or near-optimal solutions for search problems and optimization
        problems. Neural networks, on the other hand, are mathematical models that
        map between complex inputs and outputs. They can classify elements that
        are not previously known. Genetic algorithms usually perform well on
        discrete data, whereas neural networks usually perform efficiently on
        continuous data. Genetic algorithms can fetch new patterns, while neural
        networks use training data to classify a network.
